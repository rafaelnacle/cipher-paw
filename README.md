# Cipher Paw

This is another Scrimba challenge Solo project to make a password generator, it was an awesome project to learn some stuff I never did.

I did all the stretch goals for the project, which was the password length selection, the numbers and symbols toggle and the copy to clipboard.

## Features:
- Generate two options of a secure password with letters, symbols and numbers
- Toggle Symbols
- Toggle Numbers
- Select the size of your password between 10 to 50 length
- Copy your password to clipboard
